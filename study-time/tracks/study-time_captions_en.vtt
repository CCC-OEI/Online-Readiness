00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.000
Studying is essential to
any educational endeavor,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.430
but the online learning environment
presents some unique studying challenges

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.410
that you might not face in a
traditional classroom environment.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.789
This means that in order to excel
in your online class,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.110
you'll need to make sure
your study skills are top notch!

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.899
Discipline, responsibility, motivation...

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.540
these are characteristics
that all students need

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.559
in order to get the most they can
out of their classes.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.320
But online students sometimes
face additional challenges

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.140
because of the degree of independence

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.370
that the online learning system
grants them.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.819
This is why it's so important
for you to be able

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.690
to honestly and effectively assess
your own strengths and weaknesses

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.269
when it comes to your
study skills and habits,

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.039
and to develop a
process for yourself

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.659
that will enable you
to be most effective.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.159
We've created this module
on study skills and time management

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.290
to help you identify
your tendencies and habits,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.340
and provide you with
strategies for improvement.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.620
After completing this module,
we want you to know:

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.080
Why creating and sticking to
a study schedule

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.850
can be even more essential
to an online course

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.350
than a course
taught on campus;

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.730
Factors to consider when
developing a study schedule;

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.800
Why "cramming" for an exam or
assignment doesn't really work;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.920
and how to stay motivated
to complete your online course.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.360
We've broken things down for you
into three easy steps,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.750
so let' s go through them
one at a time.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.000
Step 1: identify your time management style.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.290
One of the first things you'll want to do
is to identify how you manage your time.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.780
We've created the following
6-question quiz

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.920
to help you determine your
time management personality profile.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.450
Keep in mind that your responses

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.200
should reflect what you probably
would do in a given situation,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.700
not what you think
is the "right" answer.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.950
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.910
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.880
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.840
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.810
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.780
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.750
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.700
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.680
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.880
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.950
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.910
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.870
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.840
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.819
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.790
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.740
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.950
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.920
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.880
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.849
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.819
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.810
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.920
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.540
Select the next button when
you are ready to continue.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.459
Now that you have a picture

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.039
of the time-management personality types
out there,

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.430
do you feel like your personality profile
fits the student you have been in the past?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.099
Has your previous way of doing things
worked for you,

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.660
or do you think it's time
for a change?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.000
Remember, we can all always improve!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.449
See if you fit into one
of these categories,

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:46.740
and select the next button
when you are ready to continue.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.910
Step 2: Create a schedule.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.520
Now that you've evaluated how you
have done things in the past,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.639
you'll want to think about how
you might create a schedule

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.130
for managing your time
to improve on that!

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.000
The best schedules have some
flexibility built into them,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.940
as you will undoubtedly have
unexpected situations and circumstances

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.510
arise during your time as a student.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.000
Your schedule will be unique to you,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.060
depending on the level of
detail you find helpful.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.500
There are some things&amp;mdash;due dates,
exam dates, and discussion times, for example&amp;mdash;

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.300
that should be included in your schedule
no matter what.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.130
But you also might find it helpful
to break down assignments

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.530
into steps (or milestones)
that you can schedule as well.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.340
Again, this is all about
what works best for you.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.699
Do you want to keep a record
of only the major deadlines

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.880
you need to keep in mind?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.030
Or does it help you to plan out
every day so you stay on track?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.310
Your answers to these questions
will vary depending on the course,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.760
the complexity of your schedule,
and your own personal preferences.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.580
Your schedule will also vary depending
on the course you're taking.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.820
So pull out your syllabus and
try to determine

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.830
the rhythm of the class by
looking at the following factors:

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.440
How often does your instructor expect
discussion board contributions?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.350
When are initial discussion board
contributions due?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.050
Will you have tests or exams
in this course?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.110
When are those scheduled?

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.120
Are there assignments and papers?
When are those due?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.020
Are there any group or
collaborative assignments?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.830
You'll want to pay particular attention
to the timing of any assignment

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.710
that requires you to work with others.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.270
They take a longer time to complete
when you are learning online

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.580
because it can be more complicated
to schedule times to get together.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.630
You can find many useful resources
online that will help you

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.960
keep track of your schedule.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.889
Some are basic, cloud-based calendars
(like Google calendar, iCal, Outlook),

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.860
and some (like iHomework)
are specialized for students.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.430
We all have exactly 168 hours per week.
How do you spend yours?

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.979
And now that you're a student,

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.539
how much time will you be willing
to devote to your studies?

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.090
Ok, let's switch gears here
and spend a little time

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.340
with a time management Q &amp; A.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.660
Here are some of the questions
most frequently asked by students:

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.539
<v Student 1> Do I really need to
create a study schedule

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:17.570
when I'm taking an online course?

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.000
I can honestly keep track
of all of this in my head.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Answer> Yes, you really should.
When you take a face-to-face course,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.169
you are expected to attend class
on a regular basis.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.270
There an instructor
will give you reminders

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.180
about assignment due dates
and exam times.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.370
In an online class, you don't have
this built-in structure.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.560
You're going to have to
take responsibility

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.520
for tracking class requirements yourself.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Student 2> Realistically, how much time
should I spend studying for this class?

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.479
<v Answer> This is a good question,
and a tough one to answer.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.490
Each hour of class (per week)
is equal to one unit of credit,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.539
which means that you can think
of each credit as an hour.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.330
A good rule of thumb for studying

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.750
is to study two hours
for every hour of class.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.870
So if you are enrolled
in twelve units,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.400
your schedule should give you
24 hours of study time every week.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.669
<v Student 3> Ok, so aside from
class time requirements,

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:13.860
should I account for anything else
as I draw up my schedule?

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Answer> This depends on how detailed
you want your schedule to be.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.870
Is it a calendar of important dates,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.039
or do you need a clear picture
of how to organize your entire day?

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:28.160
We think the latter is more successful,
as long as you stick with it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.600
This is also where it will be
helpful to determine

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.579
when you are most productive
and efficient.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.630
When are you the most focused
and ready to learn new things?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.899
In the morning, afternoon,
or evening?

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:37.139
Check the Quest for Online Success
course site for online tools

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:38.500
that can help you plan your time.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.979
<v Student 4> My life and school requirements
change on a week-to-week basis.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:47.589
How can I possibly account for
this when making a schedule?

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Answer> Try creating a variable schedule
in case an event comes up

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.140
or you need to take
a day or two off.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.510
<v Student 5> The way you've talked
about scheduling and time management

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.540
makes it sound like a good idea,
but it's also totally unrealistic.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.190
What's wrong with cramming?
It's what I'll probably end up doing anyway...

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Answer> Cramming, or studying
immediately before an exam

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.580
without much preparation beforehand,
has many disadvantages.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.330
Trying to learn any subject
or memorize facts

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.820
in a brief but intense period of
time is basically fruitless.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.850
You simply forget what you have learned
much faster when you cram.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:27.290
Instead, study in smaller increments
on a regular basis.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.910
Your brain will absorb
complex course material

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.480
in a lasting and more profound way
because it's how our brain functions.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.380
Finally, Step 3:
Get better at prioritizing.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.080
Due dates are important.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.070
Set your short and long-term
goals accordingly. Ask yourself:

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.440
What needs to get done today?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.920
What needs to get done this week?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.310
What needs to get done by the end
of the first month of the semester?

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.520
What needs to get done by the end
of the second month of the semester?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.970
What needs to get done by
the end of the semester?

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.680
Your time is valuable.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.580
Treat it accordingly by getting
the most you can out of it.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.380
Above all: avoid PROCRASTINATION.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.950
Procrastination is the kiss of death
to the online learner

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.560
because it's incredibly difficult
to catch up once you've fallen behind.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.130
Do you have a problem procrastinating?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.310
We're going to ask you a few
questions in this final segment

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.540
and if you find yourself saying
"Sounds like me"

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.240
more often than you say
"No way"

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.580
you'll really want to be
on your guard

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.910
so that procrastination doesn't
become an issue for you.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.290
1. My paper is due in two days

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:49.610
and I haven't really started
writing it yet.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:58.690
2. I've had to pull an all-nighter
to get an assignment done on time.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:05.670
3. I've turned in an assignment late
or asked for an extension

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:12.870
when I really didn't have a good excuse
not to get it done on time.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:22.620
4. I've worked right up to the
minute an assignment was due.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.250
5. I've underestimated how long
a reading assignment would take

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.830
and didn't finish it
in time for class.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:41.230
6. I've relied on the Internet for information
(like a summary of a concept or a book)

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.350
because I didn't finish
the reading on time.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.440
If these sound like issues
you've struggled with in the past,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.269
you might want to think seriously
about whether you have

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:53.350
the tendency to procrastinate,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.790
and how you want to deal with it
in your future classes.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.970
You're already spending a lot of
time, energy, and money

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.860
on the online classes you're taking.
Don't let all of that go to waste!

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.200
But don't worry!
We are here to help.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.630
Select each piece of
our procrastination pie

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.519
to get some strategies for
overcoming these challenges.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:19.920
Keep your studying "bite-sized".

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.209
When confronted with 150 pages of reading
or 50 problems to solve,

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:28.350
you may understandably feel overwhelmed.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.079
What if you decide that you will
read for 45 minutes,

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:33.660
or that you will
solve 10 problems?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.529
That sounds much more manageable.

00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:39.240
Turn off your phone,
close your chat windows,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.760
and block distracting websites.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.810
The best advice we've ever heard
is to treat your studying

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:50.519
as if you're in a movie theater&amp;mdash;
just turn it off!

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:54.450
Set up a reward system:
If you read for 40 minutes,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.950
you can check your phone
for 5 minutes.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.310
But keep in mind that
reward-based systems

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.550
only work if you stick
to a code of self-honor.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:08.980
Study in a place reserved
for study ONLY.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.079
Your bedroom may have
too many distractions

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:14.720
(or the ever-present temptation
of a quick nap)

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.519
so stay out of there when
working on school assignments.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:25.120
Use checklists: Make your incremental
accomplishments visible.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.529
Some people get great
satisfaction and motivation

00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:30.550
from checking items off
a "to do" list.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.120
Be very specific when
creating this list,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.420
and clearly describe each task
one step at a time.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.390
Congratulations! You're well on your way
