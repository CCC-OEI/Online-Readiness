00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.510
If you're thinking about taking
an online course, you already know

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.119
that it will require some
basic technological skills.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.060
And while you don't need
to be a computer scientist

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.330
to take a class online

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.840
(unless maybe it's a
class on computer scienceâ€¦)

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.529
it would be good for you to have
a really solid understanding

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.860
of the basic technical skills
you'll need to succeed.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.000
Understanding what these skills are
up front will make things much easier

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.149
for you as a student, which is
why we've created this module.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.350
After completing it,
you'll have an idea

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.739
of what your online instructor
might need you to know.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.170
This includes becoming familiar with:

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.199
the hardware and software requirements
of most online courses;

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.780
the value of a fast
Internet connection;

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.220
how to locate and download the free plugins
that your course might require;

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.980
the basics of email;

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.980
how to obtain tech support
when you need it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.580
Students now are taking their online
courses using a range of devices,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.110
from desktop and laptop computers
to smartphones and tablets.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.050
You may choose to do your schoolwork
on one or more of these gadgets.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.960
It's really about finding out which
form of hardware best suits

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.480
both your needs as a student and
the requirements of the course.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.790
If you're going to buy a computer,
select something reliable,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.670
and more importantly, make sure that
you have access to a fast Internet connection.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.880
We recommend, but don't require,
a broadband connection.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.920
If your computer isn't particularly reliable,
or if you don't have a computer

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.860
or other internet-capable device,
don't worry.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.320
There are plenty of places where
you can find computer access,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.090
and oftentimes for free:

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.630
for instance, your local library
or a computer lab on campus.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.530
Just make sure that the device
you choose to work on is dependable

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.200
and that the space you choose to work in
is conducive to your study habits.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.890
Slow computers and poor internet connections
can significantly increase the time it takes

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.250
for you to access and complete the
requirements for your online course,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.340
and the last thing you want to
deal with all semester

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.569
is Internet, hardware, or accessibility issues.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.290
There are some basics that your device
will need to be equipped with

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.239
in order to interact with your school's
course management system (CMS) properly.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.030
For instance, you'll want to make sure that
you have an up-to-date operating system.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.739
Your computer's operating system
is the software that manages

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.650
the programs and functions
of your computer.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.280
For the courses you take here,
you will be required to have

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.409
one of the following operating systems:

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.069
For PC, Windows 7 or higher;

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.560
For Mac, OS 10.4 or higher.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.950
Your individual course may also
have its own hardware requirements.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.420
Check with your instructor
or take a look at your syllabus

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.299
to see if there is anything else
you might need for your course.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.019
Some of these common hardware requirements
might include:

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.590
A printer;

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.029
A headset;

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.209
Speakers;

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.599
A web cam.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.150
Another factor that you'll want to keep an
eye out for is whether your course or CMS

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.129
requires a particular browser
for viewing internet content.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.909
Some content does not display properly or
particular functions may not perform adequately

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.359
in certain browsers;

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.389
however, if you view the same content
or page in a different browser,

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.689
it will look and work perfectly.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.569
So make sure that if your instructor asks
you

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.930
to use a particular browser

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.189
when completing a certain task,
you follow his or her instructions.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.999
This may seem like a pain,
especially if there is a certain browser

00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:01.659
that you prefer using when online,
but trust us&amp;mdash;it's all about compatibility.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.629
It is always a good idea to
have several browsers installed

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.599
on your machine when possible.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.980
That way you have a few
options to choose from

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.209
if you run into any problems.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.030
Some popular browsers that will work
with your school's CMS include:

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.700
Apple's Safari;

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.430
Google Chrome;

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.329
Mozilla Firefox;

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.960
Internet Explorer.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.730
These browsers should work fine
with your school's CMS, but again,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.490
they may not all work well with
particular resources or applications

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.879
that your instructor may need you
to access for certain assignments.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.849
If there are any compatibility issues
you need to be aware of,

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.060
your instructor will let you know
which browser to use

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.009
for the most reliable experience.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.199
In addition to having a browser
to view online content,

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.430
sometimes your course will require
you to install one or more

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.289
of the following plugins so that you
can view other media

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.220
that the browser alone
may not be able to handle:

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.900
like animations, sound clips,
PDFs, or any number of other things.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.500
Some common plug-ins you may
need to install could include:

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.919
Java, Adobe Reader,
Adobe Flash Player,

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.039
Windows Media Player, Quicktime,
Microsoft Silverlight.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.970
These are free applications you can
download from the internet,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.319
and your instructor
(or even your computer)

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.449
will let you know when
you need a particular plug-in

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.229
in order to view something.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.530
You will also definitely need
an email account,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.330
if you don't already have one.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.490
Lots of schools provide free email
accounts for registered students

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.800
and some insist that you use this account
for any school-related emails.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.860
Take a look at your school's email policy
and figure this out before you sign up

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.210
for any online course, because this
will be one of the chief ways

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.110
that you will communicate with your
instructors and classmates.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.479
Your instructor will probably state
in his or her syllabus

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.690
what the preferred means of communication
will be

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.400
for the term.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.220
And if you're not required to use
a school email account,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.030
you can use one you've already set up,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.930
or set up a new one with a free email service
like Gmail or Yahoo.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.840
In fact, even if you have an old email account,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.139
you may want to make a new one that reflects
your status as a college student.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:21.470
If you were an instructor, which of these
would you rather receive a student email from?

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.569
jrodriguez@gmail.com or
badboipunk4958@hotmail.com?

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.629
Now it's time to talk technical difficulties.
Here's the bad news:

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.169
during the course of your studies,

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.770
you're bound to have an issue with
your computer hardware or software.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.849
But let's face it.
That would probably be true

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.479
if you were taking a course in
a traditional classroom as well.

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.720
We suppose it's just another facet
of the modern condition.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.189
The good news is that most technical problems
are relatively easy to solve,

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:54.870
and if you're really struggling
with a technical issue,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.520
you can always count on your program's
tech support team.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.960
After all, your program is here to support
you.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.560
We want you to be able to resolve your tech
issues quickly

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.150
so that you can get back
to your online studies.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.909
Most of the issues you might encounter
when taking a course online

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:15.340
don't require a complicated fix
from tech support.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.990
In fact you should be able
to solve most problems yourself,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.699
and some may be so simple that
they seem borderline ridiculous.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.360
Bear with us while we go through
some of the most frequent issues.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.900
Some of these troubleshooting suggestions
we're about to give you

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.270
are really, really obvious.
Like, embarrassingly so.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.530
But you'd be surprised at how often these
"obvious" solutions are overlooked.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:48.400
Try some of these quick fixes if you
experience common hardware issues.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.699
Check your computer cables and connections
to make sure a cable or connection

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:54.509
has not loosened or come unplugged.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:57.349
Sometimes things shift around
without you noticing,

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.389
and it's an easy place to start.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.949
If your computer is plugged into a surge protector
(which it should be, if possible!)

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:07.219
make sure that the surge protector
is turned on.

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:12.129
It's often a good idea to reset the surge
protector by turning it off and on,

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.719
just in case this is the source of your problem.

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:17.689
If you are using a laptop, Netbook,
notebook, or tablet,

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:22.969
it is a good idea to check your
battery status often while you work.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:26.289
You can generally move your mouse over
(or click on) the battery icon

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:31.189
shown on your screen and it will tell you
just how much battery life is left.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:34.590
If the device will not turn on at all,
try plugging it in and charge it

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.860
for a few minutes before trying again.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.840
Some devices have a battery indicator
on the outside of the device as well,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.100
usually near or on the battery itself.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.510
If your computer monitor is blank,
make sure it is plugged in,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.110
connected to the computer,
and turned on.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:58.000
Next, check the brightness control,
generally located on the monitor or keyboard.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.339
If you have no sound on your computer,
check the volume control for your computer

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.040
to see if it is turned up high enough.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.720
Some applications (and some plug-ins)
have their own volume controls as well.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.620
Make sure you check both places
to resolve any sound issues.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.720
If you're using speakers, make sure
they are plugged in, turned on,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.639
and properly connected to the audio port.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:25.220
It can be helpful to test your system's sound
by plugging headphones into the audio port

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.250
on your computer to see if
you can hear anything that way.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.060
If trying one of these "easy fixes"
does not solve your issue,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.329
save your work and try
restarting your computer.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:45.560
Surprisingly, this troubleshooting
technique often works best!

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.600
One last way to find a solution is to simply
conduct an Internet search for your issue.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.540
With billions of computer and Internet
users around the world,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.540
chances are that someone has had
the same problem you're having,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.070
and that someone else
has posted a solution.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.560
The Internet is full of these kinds
of resources,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.130
from companies' official troubleshooting pages
to community help forums.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:16.100
You'll often be able to pretty easily
find the solution you're looking for.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.240
Here is some important advice:

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.399
when attempting to solve a
technical problem on your computer,

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:24.779
keep track of any messages
your computer displays,

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:28.110
and the steps you've taken
in your attempt to fix it.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.610
If the problem is really complicated,
you might need to explain to tech support

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.620
everything you've done
to try to fix it on your own.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.399
If none of these strategies work, however,
don't hesitate to contact

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:44.230
your school's tech support team.
Write down their phone number

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.250
(if you've lost internet connectivity,
you won't be able to look it up online!),

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.480
and call if you need some assistance.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.230
Remember, they're here to support you
and your studies.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.880
They'll do their best to help you
quickly find a solution to any issues they

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.380
can.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:02.940
Well done!

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.490
You have successfully completed
the Getting Tech Ready module

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.480
and we hope you are feeling
a bit more comfortable

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.839
with some of the technology you will
be using to take your online course!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.380
For additional information,
