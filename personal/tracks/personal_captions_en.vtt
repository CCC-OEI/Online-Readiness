00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.619
Have you ever had personal problems
negatively affect your academic performance?

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.650
Have you ever felt overwhelmed
or in over your head,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.770
like you were treading water,
unable to get where you wanted to go?

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.699
If only you had an opportunity to pause,
take a deep breath, and start again...

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.780
Your community college counseling staff
can offer you support

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.570
if you find yourself struggling
with schoolwork.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.030
In fact, you're not as alone
as you might think.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
Chances are that many of your peers
struggle with similar challenges.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.559
There are many different things that could
get in the way of your academic success,

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.760
and they may not have anything to do
with your ability to understand course materials

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.210
or the amount of time
you spend on assignments.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.489
Take a look at some of the common personal/social
and academic challenges you may encounter,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.000
by selecting each of these ten icons,
starting with number one.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.110
Life Roles.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.820
Many college students
find it difficult

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.440
to deal with the stress
of being a college student

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.140
while juggling many other
life responsibilities:

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.000
family, jobs, or other parts of your life
that require their time, focus, and energy.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.940
Alcohol and Drug Use.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.179
You may have to deal with issues
concerning alcohol and/or drug use.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.080
Whether it is your own use
or the use of family or friends,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.190
this is a common challenge
that adversely affects

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.380
the performance of many college students.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.000
Relationships, romantic or otherwise,
can interfere with your focus on your schoolwork.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.250
Cultural Conflicts.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.599
Some students face cultural challenges
as a result of their decision

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.860
to pursue a college education.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.869
For instance, if you're the first person
in your family to attend college,

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.179
your family might be unaware
of the pressures you face

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.000
and responsibilities you've taken on
as a college student.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.040
Mental Health Issues.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.200
During your time as a student,
you might experience a traumatic event

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
that profoundly affects you.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.489
This may include the loss of a loved one,
a serious injury,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.299
or the experience of sexual violence.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.730
It could also include depression,
anxiety, eating disorders, or the stress

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.000
of dealing with a physical disability.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.010
Imposter Syndrome.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.459
Sometimes students lack self-esteem when it
comes to their schoolwork or their intelligence.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.480
"Imposter Syndrome" refers to the feeling
that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.950
you don't belong in a particular school or
class

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890
because you're not "smart" enoughâ€“

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.959
that you're an "imposter" among
students who really do belong there.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.000
This worry can interfere
with your success as a student.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.060
Test Anxiety.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.319
Many students suffer intense anxiety

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.000
when faced with an important assignment,
an exam, or writing a paper.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.260
Poor Habits.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.859
You may come to college with a variety of
self-defeating habits such as

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.000
procrastination or poor study
and organization skills.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.719
Too Much Independence Too Soon.

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.409
Perhaps in your previous school environment,
teachers reminded you frequently

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.659
about when assignments were due, or made
all of their expectations very clear.

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.139
In your new college,
teachers may not remind you

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.980
about when you need to
complete your assignments.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.000
This could be a difficult transition for you.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.969
Long Absence.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.549
If it's been a while since you've
last been in a school environment,

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.629
whether you've been working,
serving in the Armed Forces,

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.969
or taking time off for another reason,

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.769
you might find it difficult to
transition into your new environment.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.569
Finding help may make all the difference
in your success.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.180
Community colleges have personal counselors
to help you work through these issues

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.000
so you can become a
more successful student.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.980
Congratulations! Now that you have become
familiar with some of the more common issues

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.989
that students face in the
community college environment,

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.230
you know that you can turn
to the counseling department

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.760
if you find yourself struggling with
the problems we've talked about here,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.450
as well as any others that you may face
during your time as a student.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.850
Keep in mind that counseling sessions
at a community college should not be confused

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.760
with long-term therapy. You will work
with a counselor on a short-term basis,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.450
and once you and your counselor have identified
what is getting in the way of your academic

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.290
goals,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.290
you can set clear goals about
how to overcome these barriers.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.100
In many cases, the goal of talking to a
personal counselor is to help you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.510
understand your situation and refocus
your attention on academic achievement

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.010
with someone who is objective, professionally
trained,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.190
and cares about your academic success.
