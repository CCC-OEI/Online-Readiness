00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.020
Good communication skills are
essential in your online course.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.790
There are many different ways
you'll communicate with your instructor

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.290
and other students in your class,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.680
so we've created this module
to introduce you to common terms

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.960
you'll need to know
and familiarize you

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.610
with some concepts
that we hope

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.200
will lead you to
success in your class.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.810
Our job in this module
is to teach you:

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.630
the vocabulary that may be used

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.980
to describe communication
in your online class;

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.390
how communication is different for you
as a student when you're learning online,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.879
some of the advantages and disadvantages
of academic online communication;

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.640
and how to become an effective
communicator in your online course.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.710
Let's begin with a few definitions.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.810
First let's talk about the
two types of communication

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.000
that can be used
in an online class.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.360
Asynchronous communication is when you,
your classmates, and your instructor

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.479
participate in online discussions

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.680
at different times,
rather than in real time.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.369
So if you send your instructor
a question via email,

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.890
participate in an
online discussion forum,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.409
or post to a blog
for your class,

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.070
you are communicating
asynchronously.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.020
Synchronous communication
happens in real time,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.930
like having a class discussion
in a traditional setting

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469
or talking to a teacher
after class.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.899
But you can communicate synchronously
in an online environment too,

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.799
through the use of tools like:

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.039
online chat;

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.829
internet voice or video calling systems
like Skype or Google Hang-outs;

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.939
or through the use of web-based
video conferencing software

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.200
like WebEx, Zoom, or Collaborate.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.110
The discussion board, also known as
a discussion forum or message board,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.820
is one of the most popular features
in a Course Management System,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.970
and it's one place where your asynchronous
classroom discussions can occur.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.610
Your instructor may post
the first message (or prompt)

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.120
and ask students to reply
to their initial post,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.940
or they may choose to allow students
to post a topic (or thread)

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.640
and engage the class in the
online conversation that way.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.000
Both methods are equally effective,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.280
and discussions in your online courses
are likely to vary,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.840
just like your discussions in a
traditional class can differ

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.190
depending on your instructor
and their personal teaching style.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.690
Think of a blog as a
website journal or diary.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.870
Blogs are usually run by an
individual or a small group.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.450
Entries are made periodically

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.950
and typically displayed
in reverse chronological order

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.340
so the most recent post
will appear first.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.340
Most blogs are set up

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.340
to allow readers to post
comments below each entry,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.230
and it is often just as informative
to read the comments and criticisms

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.510
of fellow readers as it is
to read the initial blog post.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
Some instructors may require you to post
or review blogs during your online course,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.810
and they can be a useful
source of information.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.600
Keep in mind, though, that blogs are
typically personal communication platforms,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.910
so be sure to double-check facts or
information you might find on a blog

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.290
with a verified source before
using it in your research.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.550
Now that we've
talked a little bit

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.950
about different kinds of
asynchronous communication,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.400
let's talk about some forms
of synchronous communication.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.090
Many course management systems
have a text-based chat feature

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.150
that will allow you to
exchange messages with others

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.630
who are online at
the same time as you.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.840
Sometimes instructors will use
the chat feature

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.760
as a way to hold office hours
or a study session.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.710
Because chat happens in real time, there
is a sense of immediate gratification.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.010
You don't have to wait several hours
(or more) for a response

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.190
like you might have to with email.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.250
Skype is a free software application
that will enable you to make

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.630
voice and video phone calls
over the Internet.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.389
Once you download, register, and
install the software for Skype,

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.030
you'll probably want to plug in a
headset or a microphone and speakers

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.740
so that you can hear others and
they can hear you more clearly.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.219
If you are using video,
you'll need a web cam,

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.229
but many newer computers and laptops

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.550
now include this as part
of their standard equipment.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.520
Video Conferencing software applications
like Zoom, Collaborate, or WebEx

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.080
are designed to support
larger groups than Skype.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.960
They can provide
a virtual experience

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.050
that closely replicates
an on-campus classroom.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.960
Many videoconferencing applications
include useful features like:

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.840
the ability to share desktops;

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.090
the ability to share files;

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.569
online chat windows;

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.840
virtual white boards;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.520
and break-out rooms
for small group work.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.270
So your computer can truly become
a window into a live classroom

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.180
where students and instructors
can interact and collaborate

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.889
at the same time.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.590
Finally, "netiquette", which is the correct
or acceptable way to communicate online.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.659
It's the code of online etiquette
you should abide by,

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.280
especially when in an academic
or professional setting.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.550
This goes for both synchronous
and asynchronous communication.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.680
Netiquette includes respectful behavior,
appropriate language,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.159
and an acknowledgement of other
people's privacy interests.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.759
Remember, your classroom discussions
should be much more formal

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.219
than the type of discussions
you may have with your friends

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.990
on Facebook or Twitter.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.919
Now that we've covered
some of the basic terminology,

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.490
let's start digging a little deeper
into these topics.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.800
Here are some typical questions
that students have about communicating online.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.550
<v Student 1> Ok, so you've told us
about the differences between

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.099
synchronous and asynchronous communication.
But what does this mean for me?

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.800
<v Narrator> Online class communication
often takes place asynchronously

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.080
rather than in real time,
giving you a chance to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.659
research, write,
and edit your answers,

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.240
instead of being put "on the spot"
during class.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.400
Think of this as an opportunity
for you to really reflect

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.610
and compose your thoughts carefully
before you make a response.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.719
Synchronous sessions are similar to what
you experience in your traditional classes.

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.110
Discussions can often
be more lively this way,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.419
because interactions are immediate

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.060
since everyone is in the virtual room
at the same time.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.080
They can also help an online class
bond more quickly,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.669
if used early in the semester.

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.860
<v Student 2> Will my online
communications be permanent?

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.219
<v Narrator> Yes--when you communicate
asynchronously online,

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.409
you create a permanent record
of your words.

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.259
All of your electronic
communication will be dated,

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.930
and because of this it can be
easily organized, stored and reviewed

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.909
(usually for grading purposes)
at a later date.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.259
Because your words are enduring,
it is a good idea

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.409
to compose your electronic communications
carefully before posting.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:37.349
<v Student 3> I generally feel more comfortable
talking online than in person.

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.840
Is online communication easier than
face-to-face communication in a classroom,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.249
too?

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:44.029
<v Narrator> It can be.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:48.059
When you communicate through email,
private messages, a discussion board,

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:51.199
or a blog,
you're somewhat anonymous.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.229
Your instructor and classmates
may not know

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:59.289
your age, gender, race, ethnicity,
or other physical characteristics.

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:02.999
Some students find that this environment
gives them extra confidence

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.909
if they are normally shy
or tongue-tied

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:08.389
in front of instructors
or other students.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Student 4> This isn't really a question,
but more of a concern.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.029
I'm worried that there will be more
potential for misunderstanding

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.539
when I'm communicating online
than when I'm communicating

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:19.430
face-to-face.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.449
<v Narrator> This is a valid concern.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:25.479
Because the teacher and your classmates
cannot see your body language

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:30.180
or hear your voice, written words
can sometimes be misinterpreted.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.020
Review your written communications
in an online course carefully

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.300
before posting and try to remove
any language that could be

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.909
interpreted as offensive
or inappropriate.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.729
<v Student 5> Can I make friends
in an online course?

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Narrator> Absolutely!

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.640
If you're normally reserved
in front of other people,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.500
an online environment can
make it feel like

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.840
you can express your ideas
more freely.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.000
Discussion boards and blogs often
create a real sense of community

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.430
as you respond to your instructor's
and other students' posts,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.310
and they respond to yours.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.980
In an online course everyone has a chance
(and is expected) to speak.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Student 6> I get that email and
discussion boards will be important,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.460
but will any of my online course
communication be synchronous?

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.880
I thought that I would be able to do
all of my online work on my own schedule.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.340
<v Narrator> It depends on the course,
but it is likely!

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.890
Many online instructors
use online chat, Skype, and

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.260
videoconferencing tools like Zoom,
Collaborate, or WebEx.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.120
It will also provide a nice contrast

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.770
to the asynchronous communication
you'll be doing in your course,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.320
because it presents an opportunity
to be more interactive.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.310
You'll want to check your syllabus
early on

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.400
to see if your instructor has scheduled
any synchronous sessions

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.710
for your online course,
and make note of those dates and times.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.060
As we already pointed out,
these will take place in real time,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.870
and you don't want to miss class!

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Student 7> Can you give me some tips

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.920
for writing effectively in an
online educational environment?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.420
I don't want to get started
on the wrong foot.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Narrator> If you can write well,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.960
you'll already have an advantage
in an online course:

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.080
effective writing is essential
to your success.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.390
But we do have some more suggestions
that you should find helpful:

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.930
Always proof your writing for spelling,
grammar, or punctuation errors.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.310
Keep your posts concise.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.430
Avoid slang and offensive language.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.410
Look for opportunities to collaborate
with other students in the course.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.100
If you find you've written a negative comment,
try reframing it in a way

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.700
that is more conducive
for creating discussion.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.820
It's ok to disagree with someone,
but being disagreeable

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.740
or making personal attacks is not.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:48.160
<v Student 8> Ok, so how do I go about writing
a respectful and respectable discussion post?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.910
<v Narrator> First, make sure that you read
your instructor's directions

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.140
and follow them carefully.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.540
This is the most basic way of showing
respect for your instructor

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.800
and the others in the classroom.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.910
Second, take your time before you respond

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.880
when your online instructor posts
topical questions to a discussion board,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.860
and he or she is requesting
your informed response.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.720
In this last section we'll review a term
we introduced earlier in the module,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.570
"netiquette", and extend this
to include email etiquette,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.790
a particularly important part
of taking almost any class today,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.940
whether it's online or face-to-face.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.560
Just as a reminder, "netiquette" is the
correct or acceptable code of conduct

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.250
for communicating online.
Here's your challenge:

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.610
Based on the tips we've
talked about today,

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.010
help Brittany compose an email
to her history professor

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.040
asking when the midterm
will take place.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.110
At each step you'll be presented
with two choices of sentences or phrases.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:12:01.260
Simply select the choice
you think is best.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.880
When addressing your teacher, include a title
such as "Professor" or "Instructor,"

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.890
unless they ask you to
address them otherwise.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.360
If you're unsure of
your instructor's title,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:21.320
you can simply ask your teacher
in a preliminary email.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.940
When addressing your teacher, include a title
such as "Professor" or "Instructor,"

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.950
unless they ask you to
address them otherwise.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.430
If you're unsure of
your instructor's title,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:39.410
you can simply ask your teacher
in a preliminary email.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.700
Even though it might be
a convenient shortcut

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.280
for texting or Instant Messaging
with your friends,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.880
don't write email or a private message
to your instructor or others in "text speak."

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.480
Punctuate your message correctly,
check your spelling carefully,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.060
and begin the first word
of each sentence

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:06.430
with a capital letter.
Showcase your brilliance!

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.720
Even though it might be
a convenient shortcut

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.290
for texting or Instant Messaging
with your friends,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.890
don't write email or a private message
to your instructor or others in "text speak."

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.490
Punctuate your message correctly,
check your spelling carefully,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.080
and begin the first word
of each sentence

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:33.350
with a capital letter.
Showcase your brilliance!

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.210
Don't use all capital letters
for certain words or phrases

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.190
in emails or private messages.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.890
Readers often interpret emails
written in all caps

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.380
as if the writer
is yelling at them.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.270
Don't use all capital letters
for certain words or phrases

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.250
in emails or private messages.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.950
Readers often interpret emails
written in all caps

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:00.000
as if the writer
is yelling at them.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.840
Great job! And thanks for getting Brittany
off on the right track with her instructor!

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.960

R: Respond.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.100
Respond to email and private messages
in a timely manner;

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.000
don't let more than two days elapse

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.760
before replying to your instructor
or another student.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.940
A: Attach.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.490
If you've included an attachment
with your email,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.640
mention it in the body of the email.
Then double-check

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.600
that you actually included the
attachment before you hit "send."

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.850
R: Re-read.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.800
This goes for emails, as well as

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.140
any other written text
you submit in your course.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.160
One of the biggest advantages
of taking an online class

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.420
is that you can really
take your time to think about

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.400
and formulate your responses
before you deliver them.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.040
You're now ready to take on any
online communication challenges

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.570
you may encounter in your course.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.500
Congratulations on finishing
the Online Communication Skills module,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.800
and don't forget to RAR!
