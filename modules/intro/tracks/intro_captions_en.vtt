00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.790
If you're watching this module,
you've decided to investigate

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.040
online learning as an alternative
to a traditional classroom.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.480
But what will this really mean
for you as a student?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.490
Here we will introduce you
to the world of online learning.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.470
We will show you how it works,
debunk a few common misconceptions

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.930
about online learning environments,
and explore some of the differences

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.390
you will encounter when
taking online courses

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.790
rather than in a
traditional classroom.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.550
Let's start at the beginning.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.030
In an online course,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.210
your instruction is delivered
over the Internet rather than in-person,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.600
in a traditional classroom.
Seems obvious enough, right?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.460
In fact, think of the course
management system (or CMS)

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.479
as a virtual classroom.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.100
The CMS is where your instructor will
post all of the course materials,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.500
conduct online discussions
and perhaps other activities,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.810
and receive your assignments.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.970
Additionally, it's where your
instructor will expect you to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
read all of the course materials posted there,
participate in the activities created,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.740
and use the CMS to
submit your assignments.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.170
Accessing the CMS is easy.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.780
You can log in using any
internet-capable device:

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.109
a computer, a tablet,
or even your smart phone!

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.420
This means that you will be able to "go to
class" whenever and wherever you'd like,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.000
as long as you have
an Internet connection.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.479
Online learning is not new,
but it is quickly evolving

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.380
to become a more and more powerful
tool for teaching and learning.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.920
That's why we think it's important
to start our discussion

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.090
by debunking some of the more common
myths about online learning.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.409
These misconceptions might
already sound familiar,

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.479
or they may surprise you.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.359
But they have gotten in the way
of some students

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.420
who then found it
difficult or impossible

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.700
to complete their online
courses successfully.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.259
We don't want you to be
one of these students.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.429
This is why we've made
this introductory module.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.229
We want to give you a clear idea
of what you can expect

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710
from online learning and
provide you with some tips

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.660
that will help you
not only to succeed,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.900
but to excel,
in your online course.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.870
Let's start by addressing
the seven most common myths

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.310
about online learning.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.420
Select from the seven tabs
to find out what they are.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.870
(Student) I've heard that
the online class is way easier

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.840
than taking the class on campus.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.040
You don't even have to go to class,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.180
you just have to hand in
assignments and you're done.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.220
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.459
(Narrator) The workload for
any particular course

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.920
is the same regardless of
the way it's delivered.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.730
And if you really think about it,
there is more reading in an online class

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.810
because you have to read
all of your teacher's instructions

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.349
rather than hearing
them in the class.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.830
In an online environment,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.269
you need to be more
self-disciplined and motivated

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.099
because you won't be facing
the instructor every session.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.629
The good news is that online classes
will give you the flexibility

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.379
to learn when you
are ready to learn

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.250
and at times that work
with your schedule.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.370
This can be a real plus for
students with busy lives.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.709
In an online class you are not
limited by class times,

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.769
so you don't have to
worry about conflicts

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.640
with other classes
you want to take,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.360
your work schedule, or
other time constraints.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.870
Whether you decide to
take your classes

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.120
in a traditional or an
online setting is up to you.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.129
One option really isn't
easier than the other.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.909
It's all about finding
the best fit

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.810
for your life, your time,
and your habits.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.660
(Student) If I'm
taking an online class,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.240
I can turn in assignments
whenever I want, right?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.340
I'll just get all of the
assignments from the instructor

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.240
and blast through it in two weeks
rather than wasting a whole semester.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.879
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.209
(Narrator) Regardless of

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.450
what you think you may be able
to accomplish at your own speed,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.920
most online courses
are NOT self-paced.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.420
Some instructors reveal
all assignments ahead of time

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.569
and others may roll out course topics
and assignments incrementally.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.900
The most successful students
will concentrate on their work

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.000
at the pace that the
teacher has laid out.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.920
Give yourself time to really
focus on the course material

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.920
and put your best effort
into the assignments.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.930
Don't try to rush though the
course just to "get it done".

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.100
The online learning world
is not much different

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.500
from traditional campus courses...

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.420
The more you put into it,
the more you will get out of it.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.060
The good news is:

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.070
Students who successfully
complete online courses

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.130
have found that the organizational
skills they learned and used

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.970
to complete their online courses
made them better students

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.110
in traditional courses
they took later on.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.940
(Student) Online courses are cheaper
than taking classes on campus.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.880
Unless you're
taking a class online,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.440
you're basically wasting
your time and money.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.780
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.100
(Narrator) Tuition and fees
for online courses

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.570
are typically the same as
for traditional on-campus classes.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.820
But there are some "hidden" costs
in taking a class on campus

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.070
that you may have
not considered.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.100
Let's see if you will be able
to save money by taking classes online.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.880
If the cost saving calculator
estimated that you will save money,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.970
and if you successfully
complete the course, well done!

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.820
Our job here then is to make sure
that you can make that happen.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.110
(Student) Professors randomly call on
students for answers in a lecture,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.860
but in an online class
I can fly under the radar.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.820
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.120
(Narrator) Don't be fooled
by the illusion of anonymity

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.150
in your virtual classroom.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.100
Even though you and your instructor
may not be able to see one another,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.370
he or she can access reports
on the quantity and quality

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.670
of your course participation,
and believe us, they will.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.360
They want to know how you're doing,
and they want to know how they're doing,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.110
and participation will definitely be
a key component of any of your classes.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.310
In fact, sometimes faculty know more
about their online students

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.940
than their on-campus students.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.080
The good news is:

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.060
Online learning can provide you
with the opportunity to develop

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.190
meaningful relationships
with your professors

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.310
and with other students
taking the same course.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.400
Conversing online can seem
strange or artificial at first,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.220
but once they get used to it, most
people really enjoy online discussions.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.890
In an online course everyone has
a chance to provide their input,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.250
and you have time to craft
your thoughts before you speak.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.680
You're not bounded by the
end of a class period

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.860
or a limited discussion time.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.430
But you'll also need to commit
to participating effectively

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.950
and you'll need specific
strategies to make this happen.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.480
(Student) I spend a lot of time
talking to my friends on social media

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.170
and I text them
more than I talk to them.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.960
I don't need to learn
any technical skills

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.740
to take a class online.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.720
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.720
(Student) I don't really know
my way around a computer,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.620
but clearly my instructor does.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.740
I'll just rely on him or her
to help me figure it out

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.440
during the course
of the semester.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.000
My online class will teach me
anything I need to know, right?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.440
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.770
(Narrator) Online learning
generally does not require

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.300
extensive technical knowledge,
but you have to understand the basics

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.250
about your computer,
the Internet,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.070
and how to use your school's
course management system (CMS).

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.170
Watch the "Getting
Tech-Ready" tutorial

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.100
for an overview of the
technology you'll be using,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.580
then be sure to seek out information
or tutorials provided by your school

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.930
about their CMS before
starting your course.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.830
Take the time to really
understand your online environment

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.400
before you get too far
into the semester.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.200
You won't want to wait until
minutes before an assignment is due

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.530
to learn which buttons you need
to push in order to submit it.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.440
(Student) Email is basically instant,
and I know my teacher checks

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.060
her email all of the time.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.700
So if I have a last-minute question
or don't understand an assignment,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.260
I can just email her and
she should respond right away.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.370
She's definitely up at 10 PM,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.340
and it only takes two minutes
to respond with an answer.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.060
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.540
(Narrator) This is a misconception
that we're sure all instructors

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.290
would like to be cleared up
from the outset.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.620
Most of your instructors provide
a maximum email turnaround time,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.720
typically between 24-48 hours.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.690
As a student, you need to
plan ahead as much as possible,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.390
and be sure to have
an alternate solution

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.040
if you don't hear back
from your instructor

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.000
before an assignment is due.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.480
Remember, your assignments are
your responsibility, not theirs.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.640
Some instructors include a "Questions
About the Course" discussion thread

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.460
where they encourage students
to answer one another's questions.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.530
This could be immensely
helpful for you,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.560
and might be a way for you
to help other students in turn.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.200
Remember what we said about
building classroom relationships?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.660
Another approach would be to reach out
to another member of the class

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.000
and exchange private emails to support
each other throughout the semester.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.520
Because you're not
meeting with each other

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:45.769
once or more times
every week,

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:48.870
it's easy to feel isolated
in an online course.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.060
Try some of these tactics
so you can connect with others.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.790
You will get a lot more
out of your classes if you do.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.399
Building supportive online
relationships and friendships

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:01.430
requires skill and practice.
The good news is:

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.910
Students who develop
good communication skills,

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.779
learn to be assertive, and are
able to cooperate and collaborate

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.350
well in a virtual environment
will find these skills

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.740
highly transferrable and valued
in their personal and professional lives

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.500
long after their course is over.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.060
(Student) "If I didn't finish
my assignment on time,

00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:20.959
I would just tell my instructor that
I brought the wrong notebook to class

or that my printer ran out of ink.

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.509
Now I can just say
my computer crashed,

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:28.169
or that I deleted my file

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:29.760
or I just sent the
wrong attachment.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.200
[ Buzzer sounds ]

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.579
(Narrator) Probably none
of these excuses will work.

00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:37.839
Remember, your instructors have not
only heard every excuse in the book

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:39.529
probably more than once,

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:42.060
but they are also pretty
tech savvy themselves.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.120
They are, after all, teaching
a college-level online course.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.389
Make sure you fully understand
your instructor's expectations

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.730
and that you comply with them
in a timely manner,

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.430
and keep an open channel
of communication with them

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.399
if you need help
or have questions.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:01.370
Detailed information about your
instructor's policies and expectations

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.269
should be included on
their course syllabus.

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:08.199
Some instructors also provide
checklists for all deadlines.

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:10.220
If your instructor does not,
it might be helpful

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.000
to create your own
assignment checklist.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.089
The organizational and
study skills you develop

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:18.300
for your first online course
will put you on the road to success

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.110
for all your future
learning experiences,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.199
whether they are online or in
a traditional learning environment.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.199
So now that we've introduced you to
some of the basics of online learning,

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:33.610
let's take the next step in
your quest for online success.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.329
Each lesson in this series includes
a variety of instructional aids,

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:40.480
activities, and resources
that will help to prepare you

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.550
as a successful online learner.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.889
And the good news is,
