# Where are the media files? 
Adding media files to this repository on GitHub would make it too large and unwieldy. Therefore the media files can be downloaded separately from the OEI website at [Online Readiness home page](http://apps.3cmediasolutions.org/oei/). On that page, download the media files using the *Download* link for the specific module(s) you're interested in. Then unzip the file's contents: 

* An MP4 video file 
* An OGV video file, for browsers that don't support MP4 
* An MP3 audio file
* An OGG audio file, for browsers that don't support MP3 

Copy all four media files into the *media* folder for that module (i.e., in the *current* folder for this module).
