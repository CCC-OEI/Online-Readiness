00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.890
All types of students
come to community colleges,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800
but no matter what brought you here,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.750
you'll get ahead if you develop
and stick to an "Education Plan."

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.000
What is an Education Plan?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.460
An Education Plan is a plan
that you will develop

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.169
alongside your college counselor
based on your goals and interests,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.300
and it basically lays out which kinds
of classes you need to take, and when.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.489
All students benefit from creating
their personal Education Plan,

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.539
no matter what has brought them
to community college

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.930
and where they see
themselves going after.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.579
We've brought in a few of our students
to show you how diverse

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.690
the community college student body is
through their stories,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.519
and how they might benefit from creating
an Education Plan for themselves,

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.550
with the help of their college counselor.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.010
We'll follow their stories up
with 5 Tips from Gina,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.600
our virtual college counselor,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.210
about the importance of creating
an effective Education Plan.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Jaime> I'm not even sure
I want to be in college.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.900
Why am I here?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.770
Because my parents say
if I don't go to school,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.039
I will have to work full time
and move into my own place.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.719
How can I possibly make an
Education Plan when I don't have clue

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.009
about what I want to do in life,
let alone my college major?

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Cassandra> So I think
I really messed up.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.320
I blew off my class placement tests and now
I have to take remedial math and English.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.200
Have I let a couple of tests
completely derail my college career?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.020
<v George> I retired last year,
but I knew that I would be happier

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.939
if I kept my mind active
by taking college courses.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.109
Do I need an Education Plan?

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Olivia> I was a straight-A student
in high school, planning to go to UCLA.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.460
But then my mom got sick and I had to
stay home to help take care of her.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.299
I still want to go to medical school
and need to develop an Education Plan

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.049
that sets me up to transfer to UCLA
for my junior year, once she's better.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.710
Please tell me that you can help me!

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Martha> I haven't been
in school in five years

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.509
and I'm terrified that I've
forgotten how to be a student.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.250
On top of that, I have two small children

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
and a husband who says he wants me
to just go back to work.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.400
I know I can't make much money with
just my high school diploma.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280
I can't waste time.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.000
Everything I take has to count
toward my nursing major.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.870
Can you help me with my Educational Plan?

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Andre> I'm here to play football,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.810
but in order to play,
I need to maintain eligibility.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.950
I hope to go pro in a few years.
Please set me up.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Edgar> I work full time
and have a family.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.000
My employer told me I have gone
as far as I can go in the company

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.650
without a Bachelor's degree.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.530
I earned a few college credits when
I first graduated from high school,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.720
but I'm not sure they're
worth anything anymore.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.810
What plan should I follow
to get to a CSU ASAP?

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.290
I'm thinking about taking online
courses toward a business major.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.760
Maybe some of these stories sound familiar
to you, and maybe they don't.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.770
But you can see that on
a community college campus,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.450
the student body is
extremely diverse.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
The California Community College system
wants to help all of you,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.730
no matter what your stories,
become successful college students.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000
So what do you have to do on your end?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.470
First, you have to participate
in an orientation,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.720
in order to get an idea of what being a student
at your community college will be like.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.790
Second, you'll take placement tests
so that your community college knows

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.760
which level of required classes
(think, math or writing)

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.540
you would be most successful in.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.250
The third step is your Education Plan,
which can be a two-step process.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.980
A preliminary Education Plan
is fine in your first semester,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.880
but after that you'll need a more
comprehensive Education Plan.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.020
Your college counselor can
really help you develop this.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.230
Gina, our virtual college counselor,
is here to tell you why

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.190
an Education Plan is so important
for you as a student.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Gina> Hi, my name is Gina,
and as you already know,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.760
I am your virtual college counselor,
here to talk to you about your Education Plan.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.120
When students come to me for advice,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.410
I tell them that a careful and
well thought-out Educational Plan

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.450
is the perfect way to
STEP up their college career!

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.900
S- Save.
When you have a plan,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.310
you're less likely to
waste time and money

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.370
by taking courses that
are not part of your plan.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.350
T- Track.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.260
An Education Plan allows you to track
your progress as a focused and driven student.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.000
You'll know when you're on track
and when you've veering from your initial

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.200
goal.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.090
But don't let that feel like
overwhelming pressure!

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.260
Did you know that many,
if not most,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.370
college students change their majors
at least once?

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.380
You're not expected to have everything
figured out from the first day of school,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.020
but even if you don't know
what major you want to pursue,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.940
or what career path
you want to follow,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.540
a preliminary college major
helps most students

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.260
more quickly figure out
what they really want to do.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.870
Additionally, if your educational goals
are to earn an Associate's Degree

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.360
and transfer to a four-year school
for your Bachelor's degree,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.350
you will want to research
the four-year schools

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.790
that could be the best fit
for you and your interests.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.240
Look at the Career Exploration module
to get you started with that decision.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.040
The ASSIST website will get you started
with transfer school information

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.730
so that you can start researching
what you should take care of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.070
at community college,
before you transfer.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:35.310
E- Eligibility. If you are
receiving Vet benefits,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.300
are an athlete, or
are receiving a scholarship,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.200
there may be eligibility requirements
that you need to keep track of.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.630
And if you're receiving Financial Aid,
it is essential that you maintain

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.950
a certain GPA and demonstrate progress
toward your educational goals

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.450
in order to continue to be eligible.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.040
All of these factors will be part
of your Educational Plan,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.720
and they will help you keep
your academic commitments and goals

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.820
fresh in mind throughout
each school term.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.420
P- Plan. Planning comes
in many different forms,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.800
but it is one of the chief benefits
to an effective Education Plan.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.430
You can plan to take courses
in a sequence that makes sense

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.910
in terms of course and
placement pre-requisites.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.400
You can balance your semesters
with easier and harder courses,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.300
as well as courses
that are more interesting

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.310
with those that may be
less interesting.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.820
Leaving the hardest and least interesting
courses

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.710
for your last semester is NOT recommended.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.710
Also, did you know that some courses
are not available every semester?

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.060
With careful planning,
you can minimize the risk

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.010
that you will have to stay an extra semester
just because you couldn't get into a course

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.169
or two.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.910
Good planning will help you
stay on top of this,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.560
and even expose you to
"insider" tactics that will

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.660
push you to the next level
as a student.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.960
For instance, have you ever
investigated the priority registration?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.790
It can not only ensure you
of a better schedule,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.740
but It will also allow you
to sign up for all the courses

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.470
that you need for a
particular semester.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.000
Make sure to find out how to benefit
from priority registration at your college.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.580
The bottom line is, when students know how
the courses they are taking apply

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.270
to their degree and can see their progress
by using an Education Plan,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.180
they're more likely to complete
their educational goals.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.889
It's as simple as that.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.310
Even if you're feeling
a bit overwhelmed right now,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.680
know that there are California Community College
Academic Advisors and Counselors

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.639
who will be more than happy
to help you out.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.430
Develop a relationship with an
Academic Advisor/Counselor

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.610
sooner rather than later,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.889
and avoid waiting until
peak advising times.

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.199
It might just be one of the
smartest things you do in college.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.900
They have a wealth of information

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.590
and are ready and willing to
help you to achieve your goals.
