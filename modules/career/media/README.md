# Where are the media files? 
Adding media files to this repository on GitHub would make it too large and unwieldy. Therefore the media files can be downloaded separately from the OEI website at [Online Readiness home page](http://apps.3cmediasolutions.org/oei/). Download the media files using the *Download* link for the specific module(s) you're interested in. Then unzip the file's contents, and copy all four media files into the *media* directory for that module.
