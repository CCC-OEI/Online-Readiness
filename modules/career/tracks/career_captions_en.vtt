00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.860
Over the course of your life,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.260
you're probably going to spend
a lot of time at work.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.180
According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
the average work day
is about 8.7 hours long.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.320
And that means if you work 5 days a week
50 weeks a year for 35 years,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.120
you'll spend a total of 76,125 hours
of your life at work.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.920
If you weren't already convinced,
that number should persuade you

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.720
that it's pretty important
to enjoy your career.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.060
If you pursue a career, you'll
constantly make decisions about it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.220
Is this the right job for me?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.580
Am I feeling fulfilled and challenged?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.180
Does this job enable me to
have the lifestyle I want?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.700
We want to set you up for success

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.040
by asking you to consider
these kinds of questions now,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.940
whether you're just graduating
from high school or college,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.740
or returning to school
after working for a while.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.380
Choosing a career is a
unique process for everyone

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.100
and for many people
the task is daunting!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.080
There are so many different occupations
to choose from,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.740
how do you even navigate
this complex "world-of-work?"

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.880
There are many different systems
for organizing career paths.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.160
Luckily, we've come up with
a five-step decision process

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.320
that will make your path
a little easier to find.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.760
Number one.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.940
Get to know yourself and the things
you're truly passionate about.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.380
Gather information about your
career-related interests and values.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.400
Think about what skills and abilities
come naturally to you

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.000
and which ones you want to develop.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.760
Consider your personality type
and how you want it to play out

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.940
in your role at work.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.940
Number two.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.960
Get to know your field.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560
You'll want to investigate the
career paths available to you.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.240
One of the most convenient filters

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.120
is to decide the level of
education you want to attain

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.920
before starting your first
or your next job.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.920
Do you want to earn an Associate's degree,
a Bachelor's degree, a Master's degree,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.860
or a Doctorate or Professional degree?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.060
Number three.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.600
Prioritize your "dealmakers"
and rule out your "dealbreakers."

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.780
Educational requirements aren't the only
area that you will want to consider.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.620
Do you want to work outside
or in an office?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.000
In the country or a city?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.120
In a big or small organization?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.400
For public service or a private company?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.580
What type of industry is interesting to you?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.660
What role do you see yourself playing in the organization?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.880
Number four.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.220
Make a preliminary career decision
and create a plan of action.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.720
Now that you have an idea of who you are
and where you might find a satisfying career,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.340
how do you start taking action
toward achieving those goals?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.920
Some people talk to family, friends,
or instructors in their chosen disciplines.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.020
Others have mentors in their lives
with whom to process this decision.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.980
Luckily for you, California Community Colleges
have career counselors and academic advisors

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.240
who can help you with both career decision-making
and the educational planning process.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.040
But be advised: you'll get the most
from sessions with your counselor

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.540
if you have done some work on your own.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.440
Get started by using the Career Café
or the Career Zone.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480
Barbara Sher once wrote...

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.560
"Find a career that you love and you will
never work another day in your life."

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.980
Number five.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.640
Go out and achieve your career goal!

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.640
Now it's time to
take concrete steps

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.580
toward achieving your
educational and career goals.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.940
This may be as simple as creating
a preliminary educational plan

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.460
for next semester or a
comprehensive educational plan

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.000
that maps out your Associate's degree.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.360
You may also want to look for internships,
part time work, or volunteer opportunities

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.100
that help you test and confirm
your preliminary career choice.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.620
Your community college counselor
can help you with this step as well.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
Your work experiences
and life circumstances

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.320
will undoubtedly change

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.260
throughout the course
of your professional life,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.440
so you may need to
go back and reassess

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.920
where you are on this path
in the future.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.420
But no matter if you feel like

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.160
you were born knowing what
you want to do professionally,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.040
or you feel totally unsure about
what the future may hold for you,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.200
remember that with careful consideration,
resolve, and strategic thought,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200
you can find a career that feels rewarding.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.880
Good luck and don't get discouraged!

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.260
This isn't an easy process

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.580
but you'll find your goals
so much more tangible

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.980
once you've set a
preliminary career goal.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.540
And don't forget–
we're here to help you!
