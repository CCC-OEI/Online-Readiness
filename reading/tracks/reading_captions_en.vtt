00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.690
In an online educational environment,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.050
you're probably going to do
more reading than listening.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.610
You may do some of your reading in printed
form,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.300
say, an assigned novel or textbook,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.460
but some of it might also be online
in the form of a webpage.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.520
Reading online isn't the same
as reading in print,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.649
so you should practice some strategies that
will

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.059
improve your online reading comprehension
and speed.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.379
And some of the tactics
you learn about here

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.100
will help you with any kind
of reading you might do,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
not just the stuff that's online.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.929
After completing this module, you'll:

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.179
understand some of the differences between
reading print versus reading online;

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.460
learn strategies for staying
focused when reading online; and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.400
discover ways to maximize your
reading speed and comprehension.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.170
So what do we mean when we say that
reading print is different from reading online?

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.810
First, when you read something
&amp;mdash;let's say, a book&amp;mdash;

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.890
that's been printed by a
reputable publishing house,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640
you can assume that
the work is authoritative.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.050
The author had to be vetted by a
publishing house and multiple editors, right?

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.350
But when you read something online, it
might have been written or posted by anybody.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.970
This means that you have to seriously evaluate
the authority of the information you're reading.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050
Pay attention to who was writing
what you're reading.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.020
Can you identify the author?
What are his or her credentials?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.360
Second, in the print world, texts may include
pictures, graphics, or other visual elements

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.420
to supplement the author's writing.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.050
But in the digital realm,
this supplementary material

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.300
might also include hyperlinks,
audio, and video as well.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.170
This will fundamentally change
the reading experience for you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.240
because online reading can be interactive
in a way that a print book can't.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.979
An online environment allows you
to work and play with content

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.930
rather than passively absorbing it.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
Finally, when you read in print,
you generally read sequentially,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.040
from the first word to the last.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.140
Maybe you'll flip to an index
or refer to a footnote,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.010
but otherwise the way you read is
fairly consistent and straightforward.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.480
Online, however, you can be led quickly
into an entirely new area of reading

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.950
by clicking on links or related content.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.700
Have you ever been studying for class
and fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580
while looking for unfamiliar terms?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.920
ou might have started by investigating
the French Revolution,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.410
but half an hour later you find yourself
reading about the experimental jazz scene

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.640
in 1970s New York.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.790
You can't really do that with a book.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.270
Now that you've heard about how
reading online differs from reading print,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.180
you should know that this has
some really practical consequences

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.600
for reading comprehension&amp;mdash;
how to understand and apply what you're reading.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.080
Improving your online reading comprehension
will save you time and frustration

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.349
when you work on your assignments.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.220
You'll be able to understand
your course subject matter better,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.040
and your performance on your
quizzes and exams will improve.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.459
Click on these three bubbles
to find out more

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.159
about the "why, what, and how"
of reading comprehension.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.319
"Why am I being asked to read this passage?"

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.379
In other words, what are the instructions
my professor has given me?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.200
"What am I supposed to get out of this passage?"

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.960
That is, what are the main concerns, questions,
and points of the text?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.960
What do you need to remember for class?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.260
"How will I remember what I just read?"

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.170
In most cases, this means
taking notes and defining key terms.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.900
When you keep the "why, what and how"
of reading comprehension

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.599
in the forefront of your mind while reading,

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.699
your understanding of the material
will improve drastically.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.100
It will only take a few minutes but it will
not only help you remember what you've read,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.740
but also structure any notes
that you might want to take.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.260
Let's put this information to use
with a short exercise.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.010
Imagine that your instructor
has asked you to create

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.820
an argument either for or against the institution
of the death penalty in California.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.600
She has pointed you to the website
www.deathpenalty.org to get started,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.020
and this is what you see/find.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.060
What terms or headlines stick out at you
so you can begin crafting your argument?

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.060
Click on the different
articles on this page

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.140
that seem like they might
help you get started.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.520
Great!

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.030
This article will have a legal argument
from a federal judge–

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.630
a fantastic place to get talking points
for your own argument.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.680
Hmm... this doesn't seem to be the best option

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.000
for your argument because it's
not directly related to your argument.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.780
Let's skip or skim this one!

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.180
Yes!

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.620
This will give you historical precedent
you can point to in your argument.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.500
Yes. A great rhetorical tactic is to use an
anecdote

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.540
from the life of a person with experience
with the issues you're talking about,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.530
and this sounds like it might be very moving.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.130
After all, it was convincing enough to
change this man's mind about the death penalty–

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.440
maybe it would sway
your audience as well.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.200
Well done.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.680
What's more convincing
than numbers,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.700
especially when it comes to
the will of the American people?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.400
Good instincts.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.120
This article may give you a
great point of counterattack

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.320
if your argument is
against the death penalty.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.740
This is another good testimony

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.470
from someone affected
by the death penalty,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.680
but it's in the form of a blog post, so
there's probably better evidence out there.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.780
Maybe come back to it if you
don't have everything you need.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.520
This doesn't really pertain to your assignment,

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.210
so it doesn't seem like the best
possible choice. Keep looking!

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.760
Great job! Now that you
have had a little practice

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.910
using your reading comprehension skills,
let's wrap up with some questions

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.850
about online reading,
courtesy of students just like you.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Question> I'm so used to reading printed
texts, and I actually prefer it

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.100
because I don't get distracted as easily
as I do when I'm online.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.639
So how can I keep myself from getting
distracted when reading online?

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.620
<v Answer> When you read online, the hyperlinks,
images, audio, and video interactivity

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.669
embedded in the text can be
a really tempting distraction.

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.780
Try reading a passage straight through
at least once without clicking

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.690
on any of the hyperlinks or participating
in any of the interactive opportunities.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.330
First, get a basic "feel" for the passage,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.690
then read it with the interactive components
to augment your reading.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.919
<v Question> I once had a teacher
who didn't want us use our phones

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.199
to read our assigned texts.
Why did she care?

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.820
<v Answer> She's probably right.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.240
It's best not to read your assignments
from the small screen of a smart phone.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.350
It's too easy to miss words
and meanings

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.220
when the reading process
itself is challenging.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Question> You've talked a lot today
about comprehension,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.389
but I'd really like to know how
I can improve my online reading speed.

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:14.319
Got any tips?

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Answer> So glad you asked!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.949
Reading quickly and efficiently
will leave you more time to study,

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:23.009
and improve your performance
in your course.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.050
To read more quickly
and efficiently online,

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.850
try most of all to avoid distractions
like ads, pop-ups, or hyperlinks

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.759
that will lead you away
from your assignment.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:38.449
Another tactic you can try is to
scan the page before actually reading,

00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:42.729
focusing on key words and phrases
rather than every single word.

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.640
This is the same technique
you just tried out

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.680
in the death penalty exercise
we went through.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.060
It will not only help you
to read faster,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.420
it'll also give you a sense
of the text's main ideas.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.850
Bravo! You've now successfully completed
the Online Reading Strategies module!

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.000
Remember, most of what you do
in an online class

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.040
will be structured around reading.
Don't you feel ahead of the game now?
