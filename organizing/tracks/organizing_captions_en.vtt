00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Host> Hi, I'm Melissa, and today
I'm going to help you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.220
learn how to organize
for online learning success!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.160
If you're taking a course on campus,
you'll meet with your instructor

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.430
and the other students in your class
at least once a week.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.920
In this traditional environment,
you will be reminded multiple times

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.260
when assignments are due.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.870
In an online environment, however,
it's up to you to remind yourself.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.330
Luckily, there are a lot of tools
out there to help you get started.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.140
But first it's important to get organized.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.800
In this module,
we'll talk about how to:

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.579
organize your physical study space,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.760
organize your course materials, and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.879
develop a scheduling system that will help
you turn all of your coursework in on time.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.020
But before we start I want to draw your
attention to the bottom of the screen,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.759
where you will see a section
labeled Helpful Tips.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.110
Throughout the module we will reveal
valuable tips and tricks

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.149
to help you organize yourself,
your space and your time.

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.960
You'll want to check each of these out
as they appear!

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.119
So what does it take to be organized?

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.520
Take control of your physical space.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560
When are you most productive?
In what kind of set-up?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.930
Everyone's preferences will be different,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.750
but once you've answered
these questions for yourself,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.290
create a place where your priority
can be concentrating on schoolwork.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.070
First, identify what time of day
you are most productive.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.520
Are you most alert and fresh
in the morning?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.220
Do you prefer to work at night,
when you've gotten other things

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.810
you need to accomplish during
the day already done?

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.020
Or is there some other time of day
that works best for your studies?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.540
It can really help to set up
some kind of schedule,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.170
so you know when you will be
sitting down to accomplish

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.850
the requirements for your course.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.350
Second, decide where to study.
Some people prefer to work at home;

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.910
others find that setting
too tempting or distracting.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.290
Some prefer the quiet of a library
while others appreciate the background activity

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.810
they find at a cafÃ©.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.959
Make sure you have a plan B location in case
your first location doesn't work out

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.709
on a given day.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.010
Maybe someone in your home
is having company over,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.200
or there isn't any more seating
available at Starbucks.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.599
But at the end of the day, it's like
the ancient Greek saying goes:

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.840
"Know thyself."

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.110
Third, what conditions will enable you
to concentrate and learn most effectively

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.910
within your study space?

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.160
Your motivation can be influenced
by the noise level, temperature, and light

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.760
in the place you choose.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.629
So bring a sweater...
Well, maybe not that one!

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.879
Pack some headphones,
or do anything else

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.400
that will allow you to tailor your
environment to your personal preferences.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.810
Once you find what works best for you,
you can make the adjustments you need

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.040
to be comfortable and get
to work!

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:52.880
<v Tipster: Tip #1> Know your constraints.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:50.420
Is your employer ok with you studying
at work during lunch and on breaks?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:50.920
Can you use your work computer
for your classes?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:51.090
Ask, don't assume.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:51.590
You don't want to step
on your employer's toes

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:52.090
or paint yourself into a corner
with your schoolwork

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:52.480
by presuming that it's fine with them.


00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Tipster: Tip #2> Know where you can plug in.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.489
Identify several places with
free wireless Internet.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.489
That way, if one network is down,
you will have an alternative location

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.720
for getting assignments in on time.
This doesn't only go for wireless either.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.590
Electrical outlets can become hot real estate
if others have the same idea as you.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.489
If you're planning to be at
a given location for a long time,

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.480
be aware of the availability
of electrical outlets.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.330
The last thing you want
is for your device to die

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.280
in the middle of a study session
or while you are working on an assignment.





00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.849
<v Host> The second element you will have
to organize is your course materials.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.780
You may prefer working with hard copies
that you can print out and write on,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.209
or you may appreciate the ease and
flexibility that comes with working digitally.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.890
Most students use a combination of both,
depending on the course or a given assignment.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.709
But both require you to set up a
reliable and convenient system

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.599
so you can stay on top
of your work.

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.250
If you like to work with "hard"
<v or physical, printed> copies,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.080
find a place where you can keep
all of your school materials:

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.260
books, notes, assignments,
binders, and a calendar.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.479
Keep a stash of basic office supplies:

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.660
pens, highlighters, paper, a stapler,
binders, folders, index cards

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.280
or any other study aids you might need.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.570
Who doesn't enjoy shopping for school supplies?

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.000
Who doesn't enjoy shopping for school supplies?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.370
Create an organizational style that works
for you.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.090
The internet can be really helpful here.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.770
A quick Google search or a few minutes
on a visual bookmark site like Pinterest

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.889
might give you some helpful tips and ideas
that could actually make a practical task

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.370
like organizing

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.280
exciting and - dare we say? - enjoyable.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.150
If, on the other hand, you prefer the ease
and convenience

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.190
that comes with an electronic
- or digital - system,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.430
you still have many options for
how to organize your materials.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.419
Again, you'll still want to have a "place"
where you can store and find your materials.

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.009
Which device will you keep your materials
on?

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.780
Where will you store your back ups?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.870
If you're saving your files on different devices,
you may find yourself wasting a lot of time

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.600
trying to locate a particular document.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.180
Avoid this by creating an electronic
organizational system that works well for

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.060
you.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.389
You may want to store files
on your own personal computer,

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.160
or you may want to take advantage
of publicly-available computers

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.130
and store your work
on a removable hard drive.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.710
Any of these hardware options
<v or combinations of them>

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.229
should work just fine.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.320
Another option is to keep your files
in the "cloud," or in online storage.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.449
This may mean emailing yourself
copies of assignments

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.430
or tapping into the free resources
offered by cloud-based services.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.490
If your files are saved in the cloud,
you will be able to access them from anywhere,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.169
as long as you have access to the Internet.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.870
Some examples of cloud-based
storage services include:

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:25.650
iCloud, Box, Dropbox, Amazon CloudDrive,
Google Drive, Evernote.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.759
<v Tipster: Tip #3> You'll want to check
cloud-services websites for their latest information

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.940
on their capacity <v how much space
they'll give you for free>,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.910
compatibility <v what browsers they support
best,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.250
do they have an app?>,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.940
and features <v which one offers the services
you'd value the most for your schoolwork>.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.780
Shop around&amp;mdash;
not all services are created equal!

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Tipster: Tip #4> Decide how to
organize your electronic course materials,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.990
including those you download
and those you create.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.669
For example, you might create:

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.630
One folder for each of your courses;

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.110
One sub-folder for each week of each course,
using a naming convention that includes

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.490
the dates of each week.
For example, Wk1_Sept01-08.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.440
Within each weekly sub-folders,
you could create another level

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.610
of sub-folders divided into "readings,"
"resources," "assignments," etc.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Tipster Tip #5> Create descriptive file names

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.440
so you don't have to open files
to know what is in it:

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.590
for example, the course title
and assignment name.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.610
<v Tipster: Tip #6> Develop a version control system

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.270
for when you go back and
revise a file you already saved.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:46.690
Some people use v1, v2,
while others use
the date.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Tipster: Tip #7> Keep at least one
backup for each of your files,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.930
and store them in a different place
than where you usually access them.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.000
So if you save your files
on your personal laptop,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.460
save them also in the cloud
or on an external hard drive.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.060
That way, if - knock on wood -
your computer crashes,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.220
you won't lose all of your work.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.389
<v Host> The last thing you'll
need to organize is your time.

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.729
The first thing you'll want to do
when you sign up for an online class

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.020
is to read the syllabus - thoroughly! -

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.060
and familiarize yourself with class
requirements and assignment due dates.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.590
Write these down immediately.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.000
It will help you get an idea of what
the rest of the term will look like

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.289
and how the course will be paced.

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:32.229
Above all, it will make sure that
you don't have any surprises

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:34.890
midway through the term.
You won't want to realize

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.199
that your first big essay is due
the day before the midterm,

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.930
when it's too late to get
either assignment done well.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Tipster: Tip #8> Create a calendar
that you can fill out

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.330
as soon as you receive the syllabus

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.560
and that you can update and consult
periodically throughout the semester.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.920
You might want to use Google calendar,
iCalendar, or another cloud-based system

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.580
that you can check from any device
and set up with notifications

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.560
for when assignments are due,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.800
or you might find that the system
that works best for you

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.690
is an old-fashioned day planner
or wall calendar.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.160
<v Tipster: Tip #9> If you prefer to break an assignment

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.560
into manageable pieces and
schedule them accordingly, do so.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.000
This can be tremendously helpful
because it will give you milestones

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.760
that will allow you to
monitor your progress incrementally.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Tipster: Tip # 10> Use a reminder or alert feature

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.140
built into an online calendar
in order to keep yourself on track.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Host> Congratulations!
Now that you have completed this module

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.860
you should be well on your way
for organizational success!

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.680
Because online learning is so flexible,
you can really tailor the experience

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.870
to your own personal preferences.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.630
Simply find what works,
and stick to it.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.800
And remember, each lesson
in this series

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.880
includes a variety
of instructional aids,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.320
activities and additional resources.
Be sure to check those materials out

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.260
if you are looking for more ideas
to help you get organized!
