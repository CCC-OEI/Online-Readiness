00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.290
How do you define success?
Well, that depends on you.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.090
You might think that "success"
is earning an associate's degree,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.270
or that it is transferring
to a four-year university.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.670
Or maybe it means receiving
a certificate of completion

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.100
or finishing some skill-based training.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.640
You could think about different
degrees of success, too.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.820
Maybe you would be unhappy
with anything less than an A

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.250
in a course, or maybe it depends
on the difficulty of the subject.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.660
Maybe, as long as you pass with a C,
you're perfectly content.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.780
But no matter how you
personally define success,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.400
you probably wouldn't consider it
to be earning a D or lower grade in a class.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.850
So if most students consider passing a class
to be the minimum requirement for "success,"

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
and most students want to be
successful in their courses,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.729
why aren't more college students
consistently successful in the classroom?

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.630
We often hear students saying:

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.409
<v Maria> I just can't do it!

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Trevor> I'm not good at math.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.979
<v Daniel> I guess college isn't for meâ€¦

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Katelyn> I'm not smart enough.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Narrator> Hey, guys?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.869
Lucky for you the research is VERY clear about
why students experience difficulty in,

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.810
and even fail, college courses, and it
usually has nothing to do with intellect.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Maria> But what is it?

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.560
What sorts of things should I do
to be successful in any given course?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Narrator> Learn how to take
effective notes in class;

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.429
Review the text and your
reading notes prior to class;

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.100
Participate in class discussion
and maybe even join a study group;

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.939
Go to office hours and ask
your instructor questions;

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.549
Give yourself enough time to research,
write, and edit your essays

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.119
in manageable stages;

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.220
Take advantage of online or on-campus
academic support resources;

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.600
Spend sufficient time studying.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Narrator> So, Katelyn,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.040
you said that the class
you're taking right now

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.260
is making you feel like

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.710
you're not smart enough
for college.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.400
Let me ask you a question:
When do you study?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Katelyn> When I can.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Narrator> Now, Trevor,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.750
you said that you're
not good at math.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.670
Who do you study with in order
to improve your math skills?

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Trevor> Well, really just by myself...

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.150
<v Narrator> So there are two problems here
that both Katelyn and Trevor have pointed

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.840
out.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.709
Katelyn, you need to make time to study
by creating a regular study schedule,

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.930
and make sure that it
is enough time as well.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.349
Most college success experts agree
that students should study

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.650
two hours outside of class
for every hour inside of class.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.870
So create a regular study schedule
that reflects this advice,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.299
and only break from it if an extreme
situation prevents you from it!

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.489
Trevor, why rely on only your own
knowledge, notes, and skills?

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.489
Try studying with another student
from your math class,

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.860
especially if you feel like
it isn't your strongest subject.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.150
Studying in a group will give
every group member a chance

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.840
to ask questions
and talk about concepts.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.439
Add a tutor to your study group,

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.500
and you'll really be able
to notice a positive difference!

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.060
Every California community college

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.170
has a Learning Center, Tutorial Center,
or Writing Center

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.189
that hires instructors and qualified
students to provide academic support.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.379
The tutoring is free, but the strategies
and knowledge you gain will be invaluable.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.290
Your tutors have taken the class
you are currently enrolled in,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.799
and they are trained to
get the best out of you.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.290
If you're taking an Online
Education Initiative (OEI) course,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.099
you'll find a link to OEI's online tutoring
inside your course

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.780
or within your course management system.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.709
Let's recap.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.290
Students struggle in college
NOT because of intellect.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:05.370
It is because of time management, organization,
and lack of quality study time.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.489
But the good news is,
there are ways to combat this,

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.969
specifically by doing things like
creating a regular study schedule,

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.650
studying in groups, and utilizing
your school's academic resources

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.620
such as a Tutoring Center,
instructor office hours,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.320
or any available online help.
