00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.020
When it comes to college,
is it all about the money?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.390
This is Chris,
and this is Taylor.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.450
Like most other college students,
they have some money concerns

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.920
related to earning their degree.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Chris> How will I ever pay for college?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Taylor> How do I finish my degree
without being saddled with huge debt?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.590
<v Narrator> Luckily for Taylor, Chris,
and every other community college student,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.260
the Internet is an extremely valuable resource
for learning about Financial Aid.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.989
Learning about how Financial Aid works
can be overwhelming at first, but trust us,

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.350
it's worth investing your
time and energy in it.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.070
Here's a quick test.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.030
You decide whether this statement
sounds like a good idea or a bad one.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Student> This financial aid
information is really complicated.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.190
I've got a job, I'd rather just work
more hours and pay for it myself.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Narrator> Bad idea! You've already
invested in yourself as a student

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.159
by deciding to go to college.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.909
Focus on school so you can complete
your academic goals in a timely manner.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.060
Luckily, you are or are about to become a
California Community College (CCC) student.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.310
The CCCs have simplified the process
from beginning to end.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.129
Please allow us to introduce you
to icanaffordcollege.com.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.189
On this website, you can find help
for each step of the process.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.840
Step 1 will answer the question,
"Am I eligible for financial aid?"

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.240
Step 2 will help you get ready to apply.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.960
Pro tip: the application process
will be much easier if you gather

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.939
the necessary information and documents you
need

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.880
like your social security card,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.590
permanent residency card (if you have one),

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.619
W2 forms and other tax records,
ahead of time.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.400
Step 3 will guide you through
the application process

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.850
for The Free Application for
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.750
and a few other common
California grant opportunities

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.760
you should investigate
as you look for money.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.370
Step 4 will let you know
where you can get help

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
at your local community college
financial aid office.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.870
Step 5 will let you know what happens
once you submit your FAFSA application.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.140
And this is really just the beginning
of how you can use icanaffordcollege.com.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.540
On this site you'll also find:

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.900
descriptions of the different types of aid
available,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.370
special resources for Veterans,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.470
information about the Dream Act,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.430
and more ...

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.250
Two pages you won't want to miss are:

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.720
Important Dates/Deadlines page, and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.769
Board of Governor's Fee Waiver page.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.800
So why not start today?

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.519
After you've figured out what kind
of financial aid you qualify for,

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.700
keep in mind that there are additional costs
during your time as a college student.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.950
Not only is there a wide range of incomes
among community college students,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.790
but there is an equally wide
range of expenses.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.319
Some students are only supporting themselves,
while others are also supporting large families.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.519
Whatever your income and expenses,

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.150
you are in good company among
other community college students.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.390
After you've learned more about Financial
Aid

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.930
and how it can help you,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.650
you'll want to start thinking about the best
way

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.489
to manage your funds and school-related expenses.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.239
The California Community Colleges
can help with this too!

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.959
At www.cashcourse.org, you can register for
the CCC's

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.849
free comprehensive money management tool.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.019
You'll also find videos, quizzes, and financial
tools

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.629
that will help you learn the basics of budgeting

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.640
and how to complete your education
without running up a huge amount of debt.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.150
We'll teach you how to manage your funds
and estimate how much money you may need to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.590
earn

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.260
to support yourself
during college and beyond.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.579
The site provides practical financial skills
without selling any financial products or

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.420
services

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.400
&amp;mdash;â€”there's no "catch"!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.100
The bottom line is this:

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.550
One of the biggest reasons students don't
complete their academic goals

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.040
is that they spend too much
time and energy at work.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.860
But if you take advantage of the
various kinds of financial help

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.920
that California Community Colleges offer,
you can make the most of your time

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.140
as a student and save money
at the same time.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.800
In this module we've introduced you
to a couple of important websites

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.110
you won't want to miss, but there
are numerous other resources

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.030
you'll want to investigate to get
the most bang for your buck!

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.610
Be sure to visit the Financial Aid office
at your local community college

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.240
for assistance as well.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.200
They are experts in this area
and will have additional information

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.130
on scholarships and grants
that you'll want to check out too!
