# Online Readiness
This repository contains the source files for the *Online Readiness Tutorials*, a series of interactive multimedia tutorials designed to address the real challenges experienced by online students, new and experienced, while pursuing success in online classes. The tutorials were developed by The Online Education Initiative (OEI) of the California Community College System. For additional information about OEI please visit the OEI website at [ccconlineed.org](http://ccconlineed.org/). Live versions of the tutorials are available on the [Online Readiness website](http://apps.3cmediasolutions.org/oei/). 

## Downloading the Tutorials 

The downloadable version includes all source files necessary to provide a fully accessible, interactive experience for students, **minus the media files** (see below for instructions on downloading those). The current release (or any prior releases) of the core application can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/CCC-OEI/Online-Readiness/releases) page in either .zip or tar.gz format. 

After downloading and unzipping the files on your local computer, all files can be viewed locally except the multimedia version of each module, which must be played on a web server.  

## Downloading the media files

Adding media files to this repository on GitHub would make it too large and unwieldy. Therefore the media files can be downloaded separately from the OEI website at [Online Readiness home page](http://apps.3cmediasolutions.org/oei/). On that page, look for *Download* links associated with each module. Simply follow those links for the specific module(s) you're interested in to download a zip file that contains the following four media files:

* An MP4 video file 
* An OGV video file, for browsers that don't support MP4 
* An MP3 audio file
* An OGG audio file, for browsers that don't support MP3 

Unzip the downloaded file and copy all four media files into the *media* folder for that module. For example, the media files for the **careers** module would be copied into the **/modules/career/media** folder. 

## About the Media Player 

The Online Readiness application was built using [Able Player](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer), a standards-based, fully-accessible, open-source, cross-browser HTML5 media player.
